The first problem in the Study Materials department When I upload images inside the material, they are completed successfully, but from the studentâ€™s interface, if he opens the attached image, it appears behind the dashboard of the material !!

The second problem in the same section as well When i attach url link it is added successfully But from the student interface it will appear as normal text that cannot be clicked It is not a hyperlink!
